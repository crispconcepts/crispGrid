crispGrid

## Why use crispGrid?

Because it's simple and effective. There's a lot of great, and not so great, grid systems out there already. I developed this one out of a desire to have something without so much overhead. As I began actually utilizing it in projects, it's scope grew somewhat. But I still strived to keep it as simple as possible.

One of the big things that differentiates crispGrid from the others, is the ability table grid. As you may have heard, use of tables in development these days is generally frowned upon unless you're displaying huge amounts of data. While it isn't the pure CSS solution that some of you purists may insist on using, it's still simple to use and has a low overhead thanks to JQuery and and modified version of Matt Banks EqualHeights plugin. https://github.com/mattbanks/jQuery.equalHeights
